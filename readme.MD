# Java Tutorial Repository

Welcome to my **Java Tutorial Repository**! This repository will serve as a comprehensive collection of tutorials and resources that I will be using throughout my journey of learning Java. It includes code examples, explanations, and practical exercises to help you (and me) build a strong foundation in Java programming. Every tasks and exercise is from University of the People, Excercism and Freecodecamp.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering **Java**. Whether you're new to Java or looking to deepen your understanding, these tutorials cover topics ranging from the basics to advanced concepts. Each tutorial includes step-by-step instructions, code samples, and exercises designed to make you a better Java programmer.

The repository will be updated regularly as I progress through my Java studies. Here are the key areas covered in this repository:

- **Java Basics**: Data types, control structures, and basic syntax.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Advanced Java Concepts**: Collections, streams, concurrency, and design patterns.
- **Practical Projects**: Hands-on projects that apply what I learn.

## Setup Instructions

To follow along with the tutorials and run the examples on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Download and install the latest version of JDK (Java Development Kit) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
   
2. **Set Up Your IDE**:
   - Install [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
   - If using **VS Code**, install the **Java Extension Pack** from the Extensions Marketplace for a smooth Java development experience.

3. **Clone This Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sean15535/Java-Tutorials.git
     ```

4. **Navigate to the Tutorial Folder**:
   - Each tutorial is organized into its own folder. After cloning the repository, navigate to the relevant tutorial folder:
     ```bash
     cd java-tutorial-repository/tutorial-1
     ```

5. **Running Java Files**:
   - To compile and run a Java program, open the terminal in VS Code and use the following commands:
     ```bash
     javac Main.java
     java Main
     ```
